# House-Price-Prediction

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of historical house sales, where each record represents a house and includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, how old , etc., build a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of a new house based on its features.

## Solution
The task involves exploring the data, preprocessing and cleaning it, selecting relevant features, building a suitable machine learning model, and evaluating its performance. The ultimate goal is to create a model that can predict the selling price of a house with high accuracy, which can be used by real estate agents, home buyers, and sellers to make informed decisions.

## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. Flask
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. Pickle file
5. MongoDB


## How to run?
Before we run the project, make sure that you are having MongoDB in your local system, with Compass since we are using MongoDB for data storage.

### Run the application server
```bash
python app.py
```
